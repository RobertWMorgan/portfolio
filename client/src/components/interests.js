        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
          My love with music started when I learned to play the drums. It introduced me to many different types of music and let me explore a more creative side of myself. 
          I&apos;m rarely not blasting music and listening to bands like DON BROCO or Dance Gavin Dance.

        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <p>
          I&apos;m an avid video game player and enjoy playing games like OSRS and Monster Hunter.
