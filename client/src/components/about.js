        I&apos;m an aspiring London based Junior Full-Stack Developer. During my career in digital marketing, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS and was enamored by the depth and challenge of web development.
        This led me to joining the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly where I fell in love with coding.
